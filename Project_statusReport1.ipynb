    "\n",
    "This project generates a large amount of N2O gas measurements over the growing season at multiple locations. Each sampling event is sampled over a time sequence of 0, 15, 30, and 45 minutes. Measured N2O concentrations are regressed against time and the resulting slope is used to calculate the N2O flux during that sampling event. Linear extrapolation is used to estimate flux between sampling points and then season-long emissions are estimated. We currently have been performing these calculations in Excel, but having a code in place would streamline the process and would help reduce human errors."

The 2018 data has already been collected and analysed before I came onboard. I created a small sample data set that is easier to work with and that could be used to test my code. I was able to upload it properly as a .csv file.\n"
